 * Jitendra: Multiraft-problem has been found
    --> In case of multi-raft, multiple leader on the some Datanode can cause performance issues
    --> Is randomization enough after some problem, during re-election?
    --> Is it possible to write via a follower?
    --> Multiple SSD can be used for Raft logs (can be useful for for Multi-raft)
    --> Shashi: we see performance problems when tests run with only a few clients (under investigation)
    --> flush is one problem (we have stronger guarantees)
    --> We need to check if sync is required for Raft log.
    --> Can we do it with increase the leader election timeout on all datanodes which already have too many leader roles?

 * Uma: ViewFS status
    --> First patch is committed, on the trunk, can be tested

 * Move to TLP?
